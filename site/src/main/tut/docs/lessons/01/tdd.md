# Test Driven Development

An interactive session building a simple bank account using TDD and Pair Programming.

 * [TDD Bank Account Kata](https://github.com/xp-dojo/bank-account-java) in Java


## Learning Objectives

During this session, you will:

* Practice implementing requirements using TDD
* Practice Pair Programming

This is not a session to learn about any particular framework or library other than defacto unit test libraries (JUnit for Java, for example). There is generally no reliance on build tools and you should expect to be able to open project files in the IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDEs.


## Structure 

A brief introduction then hands on coding. We wrap up by reflecting on how it went and what the attendees might do next to continue the experience.


## Instructor Notes

See the `INSTRUCTOR.md` file in the underlying repositories above.
