# Acceptance Test Driven Development

An interactive session building from [Test Driven Development Session](../01/tdd.html) to explore acceptance testing.

 * [ATDD Bank Account Kata](https://github.com/xp-dojo/atdd-bank-account) in Java and [Concordion](https://concordion.org/) ([Download as ZIP](https://github.com/xp-dojo/atdd-bank-account/archive/master.zip))


## Learning Objectives

During this session, you will gain insight into:

 * Acceptance testing 
 * Agreeing acceptance criteria with customers and creating executable specifications
 * Breaking requirements down into small deliverables that can be demo'ed to the customer
 * The importance of iterating to improve understanding of requirements
 * The appropriate level of abstraction between acceptance criteria and running code (allowing you to build large maintainable testing infrastructure)
 * Some common pitfalls with acceptance testing
 

## Structure 

 1. Intro to acceptance testing and Concordion (see the [slides](https://github.com/xp-dojo/atdd-bank-account/blob/master/slides.pptx?raw=true)) (10 mins)
 1. Start coding following the instructions in the underlying repository (80 mins)
 1. Instructor demo of reference implementation (30 mins)
