# Working with Consumer Driven Contracts

An interactive session building on the [Test Driven Development Session](../01/tdd.html) and [Acceptance Test Driven Development]() to explore enforcing contracts between services, in this case communicating over REST/HTTP.

* [Working with Consumer Driven Contracts](https://github.com/xp-dojo/consumer-driven-contracts) in Java using [Pact.io](https://pact.io/) ([Download as ZIP](https://github.com/xp-dojo/consumer-driven-contracts/archive/master.zip))


## Learning Objectives

During this session, you will gain insight into:

* How to ensure the APIs you depend on don't change and accidentally break your applications
* How to safeguard against accidentally breaking other peoples applications that rely on your APIs
* How contract testing and other techniques can work together to give you confidence when working with external APIs
* How contract testing allows you to develop your application confidently without the explicit need for continual integration testing
* When contract testing can't be employed and when alternative techniques over other advantages
